			<h2>What is Photon and why do we need it?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Photon is a minecraft server software. It's a program that allows people to play together. There are already two big server softwares out there: the mojang's one ("vanilla server"), and the bukkit's one ("craftbukkit").
			But they have several problems:
			<ol>
				<li>CraftBukkit is built on top of the mojang's vanilla server, so <em>it depends on mojang's program</em> which is very difficult to understand.</li>
				<li>CraftBukkit is facing <em>legal issues</em>, therefore you can't download it as usual.</li>
				<li>They are not using all the available computing power we have today, resulting in poor performance sometimes.</li>
				<li>They do <em>not</em> allow devs to modify the core of the game.</li>
			</ol>
			The goal of photon is to build an alternative software, free of all these issues. Photon needs to be fast, extensible and independant from the vanilla server.
			There are also newer community projects for minecraft, like the Sponge API. But Sponge doesn't aim to create an independant multi-core server.

			<h2>The benefits of Photon</h2>
		</header>
		<p><h3><span class="icon style1 title fa-code"></span>Independant</h3>
			Photon is made from scratch and with open libraries. It is therefore free from mojang's proprietary code.
			Moreover, a large part of its code will be available on github.
		</p>
		<p><h3><span class="icon style2 title fa-bolt"></span>Faster than light</h3>
			Optimized at its core, it aims to deliver lightning-fast performace: high TPS and low RAM usage.
		</p>
		<p><h3><span class="icon style4 title fa-desktop"></span>Multi-Threaded</h3>
			You've asked it for years, it's becoming true: a 100% multi-threaded server that
			uses all the available power of the modern computers.
		</p>
		<p><h3><span class="icon style5 title fa-cog"></span> Extensible</h3>
			Designed to be extensible, Photon allows the devs to modify every single aspect of the game.
			Plugins can listen to events involving blocks, entities and players.
			They can add new blocks, items, entities, world generators and permissions system.
			They even have access to packets!
			The only limit is your imagination.
